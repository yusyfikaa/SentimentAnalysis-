The quality is the same because the cost is constant regardless of where you have the procedure. It's cheaper in government clinic because it's subsidized by tax; the same money paid by private dental clinics to government. Private also needs to make profit so they can pay rent, wage, bills, costs; things that are irrelevant to a government clinic.

Like, there are no secret Malaysia Illuminati who intentionally jacks up the price of scaling just to fuck with us.

Private also needs to make profit so they can pay rent, wage, bills, costs; things that are irrelevant to a government clinic.

- admin heads are rotated every n years, meaning theres no appreciable amount of time or incentive to enact long term cultural change. Forget about planning, focus on reacting to whats in front of you.
- departments fight for money, you dont use your allocation? You lose it next round. This way, everyone frames their needs as earth shattering, and the administrators get numb to all the bullshit, making the decision process worse

I'm not arguing that funds are not used for the benefit of the people.

I'm saying that the perception of funds being diverted for personal gain has led to a lack of trust amongst the people in our government. That lack of trust has carried over to the payment of tax. This logic is premised along the lines of ""why pay such high taxes to fund the extravagant lifestyles of our politician fatcats?"". 

Note: I'm not saying its one way or the other. But that this perception exists.

Nope. 

We have many medical centers both public and private. Currently testing is refused unless a patient meets certain criteria of which most notably requires a patient to have been in close contact with a confirmed case. This instruction is seemingly on the basis that we do not have a sufficient supply of testing kits. 

Attack PH and the current PN government all you want for the lack of testing kits. But its mischievous to claim that the rollback of clinic 1M is linked in anyway to the lack of widespread testing.",2020-03-18 06:28:07,public health,,reddit

which is evidently why our healthcare infrastructure is underfunded, workers underpaid. 

(ps inb4 you blame Najib jho low rosmah lahanat then i have no energy to argue against that)

you may think the system is not underfunded, because i guess you haven't work a 14 hour shift to rest in a airconless lounge for 2 hours then go back to another 14 hour shift, and after 2 years they ask you to continue working without a permanent contract. 

(ps inb4 you say it's oversupply you can work for private what free market, then i also tak larat to argue against that)

anyway, that line of argument is why , IN MY OPINION, people who can afford to pay to offset SOME of the cost, should. 

why? also because the current FREE FOR ALL system is open to abuse, and everyone takes it for granted, and we simply can't afford it in the long run. 

(ps inb4 you say the system is not abused it's every taxpayers right then lahanat i also tak larat to argue d)

Edit: I did some digging- focusing more on the cost significance.

1. Attendance to Hospital & Special Care in 2021:  4,041,378
2. Assuming we increase the cost to RM 20. It'll be RM 80m.
3. MOH's 2023 Budget: RM 36.33b 
4. That's 0.22% out of the budget. 

Based on that, I take it as insignificant if the intent is to assist with the cost structure. 4 million users will find it more difficult to adjust to an increase of RM 1 to RM 20, rather than the government increase the %/GDP for MOH in 2023.",2023-06-02 06:52:42,public health,,reddit

,"For all it's flaws there's a lot we can learn from UK NHS.

Now a lot of their medics are on strike because of poor pay and working conditions. The system is free to access for anyone, yet I've never seen a single medic's union advocate for putting in a service charge. Instead they're advocating for better management and efficiency. They are as proud of the free NHS as Americans are of their Military. 

The system is a backlogged, but at least if I need an ambulance and ER I know I won't have to pay. It's supposed to be a baseline safety net. A lot of people who can afford it, the UK's T20, have health insurance and go to private hospitals where you get better choices of specialists and priority access and private wards. But if you attend the NHS you won't necessarily get your choice, everyone is treated equally, in a shared ward if its clinically appropriate. It won't be a great time like what T20s want, but at least they're not dead.

I don't think KKM hospitals should be in the business if providing any form of premium services. They need to treat give everyone the same equal service, for minimal cost. Maybe that will encourage those who can afford it to use private health care, while the KKM acts as a basic safety net.",2023-06-02 10:15:31,public health,,reddit

Our government is pretty rich in this regard to be able to provide free healthcare but then again it's also the fact we are rich in oil and our oil prices aren't cheap provided to M40's and T20's\[Try look at other countries being shocked **recently** (from fuel price increase) to refuel full tank at price of $50(averaging $2000 a month) while we also been paying MYR50(averaging MYR2000 a month for the past decade\].

If you charge RM100 there's really no point going to gov hospitals since most flu/fever cases are charged inbetween RM40-80 in private clinics. Which will make most of the bottom of B40's to suffer financially. RM1-RM10 is a reasonable price for B40's

The main reason to increase this is to allow it to be sustainable. At the moment, the government subsidises these medical costs. Every year, the amount required increases by a large amount requiring even more government support. It simply cannot be sustained in the long term. 

I'm very grateful that we have one of the best healthcare systems on the planet, and it's cheap to boot.

1) because they dont seek help early, conditions easily preventable early on worsen, costing the govt more money to handle.

I'm not blaming the universe by the way, I blame the system which as I've tried to communicate to you is broken. Making it free doesn't solve that problem.

Wooden_Cream_4540,"OP living in dreamland. My old man has lung cancer. We went to gov first. Below are some important interactions between him and the doc. This was back in Dec 2023.

After CT scan:
Doctor: “so yeah the lump is confirmed to be cancer”
Dad: “what stage?”
Doctor: “I don’t know. But looks like it’s stage 2, I think u can chill and continue to proceed with your plan on flying to Canada. But I think it’s pretty serious so it’s best to treat it.”
Dad: “… so what stage is it??”
Doctor: “I not sure la. But u can relax and enjoy your trip in Jan. But I think have to faster treat, we also need to do biopsy”
Dad: “….ok”

We proceeded to stick with him and do biopsy. Lung is a difficult area to extract the samples so my dad had to go through a collapsed lung during recovery due to surgery complications. But we weren’t mad because the doctor had explained to us beforehand that it’s a difficult area.

After biopsy which took 3 fucking weeks cause it was December:
Doctor: “so here’s the thing, we only extracted enough samples to test for 4 mutations, there are 16 mutations”
Dad: “what??? U know it’s a difficult area to extract samples. And y’all just took enough only for 4 tests?”
Doctor: “uh well, somehow the sample not enough”
Me: “Aite say no more. We’re outta here.”

Fast forward 2 weeks, we cancelled our trip cause my old man lost 10kg in a week, looked like on death’s door. Brought him to private, they immediately set him up with mri and pet scans and discovered it is stage 4 and it has spread all over, immediately gave him chemo while waiting for blood biopsy test to determine the mutation for targeted therapy. The private doc was so shocked, he remarked “why they so slow ah?” This was in January this year.

He is now much better. On the latest scan, u can no longer see the cancer with naked eye. It’s still there but it’s so small now it doesn’t quite show up on scan.

EXkurogane,"I worked for the the gov sector for 7 years, up to as recent as late 2023. Waiting time is a huge problem. The difference is highly urgent / life threatening cases wait slightly lesser time than ordinary cases, but ""slightly less"" can also be as long as several months. Some people will inevitably die waiting unless they go private. For cases that are non urgent, you can be in a queue for easily as long as several years.

The second problem is there's also this anti-civil servant bias, both from the general public and also private employers. ""Government doctors useless one"". I heard this a lot from people - the refuse to go to gov hospital. Meanwhile, many employers / private clinics refuse to even see you for a job interview if you have never worked part time in private sector before (called locum), not to mention hiring you. Presumably because government doctors and dentists are useless, despite seeing 50 or more patients a morning.",2024-06-13 06:19:47,public health,,reddit

thelvaenir,"Waiting times are very long in govt hospitals. The definition of ""urgent"" is very narrow i.e. you are definitely going to die in the next 24 hours if you don't get treated. Only then you might get someone to look at you. In private, you can get treated as long as you have the money to pay.

Facilities and hygiene is also a huge difference between govt and private. Not all govt hospitals but the ones I've seen really look.. deplorable. Private hospitals, not all but many, look like 5-star hotels.

Govt hospitals also give generics and cheaper drugs to reduce cost. Not saying all generics and cheaper drugs are bad, but when your life/condition depends on it, you at least have the option of paying for the best drugs and medication in private.

But yes, govt healthcare is almost free. Private healthcare is not for everyone.",2024-06-13 08:15:43,public health,,reddit
Wonderful-Skin9445,"they choose private hospital bcoz they have medical insurance. but probably didn't realize that their coverage is not big enough to cover the whole treatment cost, and in the end have to ask for donation. back then medical insurance annual limit coverage for medical treatment are not that big of an amount. but recently, you can see that most insurance company are offering medical limit up to RM 1 million annually. this bcoz the cost of medical treatment keep rising each year. 

I terms of waiting time in gomen hospital, yes no waiting time for red zone emergency cases, but in terms of any other cases, you have to wait, even when u need surgeries, there are queues and you hv to wait for your turn.

to bypass this, u hv to go get checked by private hospitals, get the results & report and bring to gomen hospital to validate that you need urgent attention (this is what we do for my late father who were diagnose with leukemia).

I believe one of the reason why ur private cancer hospital send patients to gomen hospital is not bcoz of better facilities or equipment. private hospital have the facilities & equipment. it is just that the hospitals are afraid that patient cannot pay the cost of treatment bcoz it is soo expensive, and also to deflect any liabilities if anything bad happened to the patient. just send to gomen hospital and let them handle it.

btw, treatments & meds are not free in gomen hospital but subsidized. u still have to pay for some portion of it. it gets cheaper if ur gomen staffs or gomen pensioner",2024-06-13 13:21:20,public health,,reddit

,"After reading the comments here, we can collectively agree private hospital gives better services and faster. Government hospital, albeit not all, are experiencing over volume of patients everyday.

You pay a high fee for your life but it worth it rather than waiting to lose your life at government hospital. Even in term of facilities, I feel that a lot of government hospital now are very run down and old. They are in dire need of upgrade especially in the smaller cities and rural areas. Of course those areas are the least the government would give attention to or even any budget. I travel a lot and I've seen a lot of hospitals.

Mindless_Lychee1445,"Unfortunately this is Malaysian own citizens' trust in our own healthcare. It is extremely misplaced. 
Not whether the healthcare or outcome is good or not.

This issue is close to my heart and feel so hurt by it. 
Family and relatives are pushed to be physicians, so many became physicians by being educated locally and overseas and end up everywhere (lots of stories to compare)

Inferiority complex:
Our public healthcare, if you as govt doctor go for conferences, usually they get Indo and Philippine doctors as conference speakers. Cause a lot of our doctors now produce from ""factory"", so need shiok sendiri (feel good about self) to look down on less developed countries, but are extremely afraid to invite developed country speakers.

If in govt and want further improve in developed countries like UK, Aus etc, and self pay, you get threatened with punishment (tatatertib) or study leave not approved even though already accepted in other country to further study.

The whole crab in bucket mentality

Recognition:
Our public healthcare also don't recognize many developed country specialists or even unis.

Medical practice:
In terms of prescribing medication, my experience with  private physicians, majority simply prescribe. Our prescribing probably worse than India prescribing. Pt informed consent is not practiced. Like what the... apparently your medical school no need pass prescribing exam base on best practices?
Hey, there's difference between expectorant and cough suppressors okay? Be careful of prescribing antibiotics and steroids la. 
And don't give GI antibiotic for pulmonary issues la. Not one antibiotic can replace the other. Each situation has its own med.
 Where's the labelling?
This the govt healthcare better in my experience, medication name given. Not batuk etc.

Emergency department not able triage serious issues that appears non serious. People who have subarachnoid hemorrhage and epidural haemorrhage (both are bleeding in brain) can walk into ED like nothing happen k? Don't v tell them ""boleh jalan, balik rumah"". People die la, darn it. The signs of brain bleed quite obvious if you're trained.

No kerjasama and recognition with other healthcare workers:
a. Nurses, MA all deserve respect. 
b. Physio, dietitian and optometrist are part of healthcare too.
Singapore is weak here too, but they started registering in 2013/2014. Malaysia supposed start registering this allied healthcare workers but I checked beginning this year, not able register these healthcare workers.
C. So many cacat people cause by things like strike, could have been living normal lives with physio. But too late when I see these people.
d. Private physicians, don't just sell your own stock of medication la. Sometimes the most suitable drug, you no stock, don't la simply prescribe me medicine from your stock. I rather you prescribe the correct med and I go pharmacy buy (also partially applies to govt Docs)

Healthcare education:
Hard to find good physio and dietitian (or even good doctors), lol.
Dietitians, your textbook talking about margarine and soya milk doesn't apply to Malaysia, k? Please read up ingredients and research papers (overseas margarine are low in trans fat, soy milk are fortified with calcium, buying soy milk from pasar not the same la).
Already talked about doctors in earlier category.

Pt (patient) mentality:
In developed countries pt have family doctors they frequently visit, some sickness need to be seen multiple times before solved, some need to be seen periodically. In Malaysia, pt want quick fix in one meeting (and some v want money worth), so physicians prescribes really strong medications or many medications (so that pts feel they paid for their time worth)

Also, I went for a colonoscopy a few months ago for cancer screening, which in HUKM cost me around RM500. Private hospitals would have cost me at least RM3,000. I would not have screened it had I been asked to do it in a private hospital. The wait time does not deter me, I can wait. I still have to wait hours to see the doctor in a private hospital anyway. 

If the government is having a funding issue with the healthcare system, I would suggest they raise the tax.

I spent 1 night in HDU in the private and 4 nights in HDU in the public before moving to a normal ward. The private charged my insurance 3k+ while there were no charges for public because it is an infectious disease, my follow up with the public hospital was also free.

Private is comfortable and clean but the medical competency of the staff isn't guaranteed either. There's an assumption that privatization attracts better staff because of pay, but some are just in it for the money and don't actually give good medical care.

The public hospital and KKM kliniks in my area have decent staff, though I heard it is not the case in all places.

I have company benefits which I can't finish utilising even after going to a private dentist and asking them to do the full work up on my teeth. I won't be frequenting a public dentist because I'm adequately covered there. On the other hand, if my tax payer's money is used to fund necessary medical treatment to those that can't afford private healthcare, have lesser benefits or maybe they can afford private healthcare but will feel the dent to their finances, then I'm happy it's being utilised appropriately.

Do correct me if I'm wrong in my understanding.

Though I do disagree with the suggestion here to charge more for T20. T20 is like what, 11k household income for KL? I assume that's gross so nett is 8k. Imagine if a couple has say, 2 kids. With mortgage, car hire purchase, daycare/school fees, fuel, groceries, allowance to parents, you're still not very well off especially in you're based in KL.

The ""true"" affluent peope will just go to private, no biggie. Scaling is RM200++, filling is RM300++. If gaji is 20k, it's not a lot for them. Plus they would have company benefits to cover anyway. If they go to public still, hey they kinda paid for it with the significant 25% tax on income. 20k salary is 4-5k on tax paid monthly, surely you can't fault them for going scaling at a public dentist once in a while?

On a serius note we paid at least this much for hospital visit at any private hospital and sometimes we even need to wait at least half a hour before the we are able to see the doctor.

And those scholarships funds are from us thr people who pay taxes. And most of the doctors leave the government and work in the private sector once they already completed their contracts.

So assuming figuring out how rich people are cost absolutely nothing, and there were no additional costs for implementing such a system, we'd generate a whopping 0.75% additional on our budget.

The UK also has very limited private healthcare scope due to extortionate health insurance fees that covers very little scope and excludes virtually all acute and emergency conditions.

Firstly, the price for healthcare is ALREADY pro-rated for the different income groups because the different income groups already pay DIFFERENT amounts for their taxes.

so, T20 person will pay more to the government compared to B40 person. 

You complain of inadequate salary but that is not because of the ""cheap"" admission fee but because of the unwillingness of the government to meet the demands of the healthcare workers. 

Money? the issue of money does not stem from the ""cheap"" admission fee but from the[ government's wastage](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2023/08/24/govt-to-continue-eliminating-leakage-wastage-says-pm), and the many corruptors siphoning off money from the coffers.

And guess what's cheap to fill yourself up with, especially if you're on a tight budget? Simple carbs like sugar and white rice. Which only make you crash later with greater hunger. 

Malaysians in general have poor education for nutrition. Yes, even Malaysians with healthy weight. A ""healthy"" meal in Malaysia like chicken porridge is usually 95% simple carbs, 5% of protein, and practically 0 veggies. Balanced, it is not.

It's just the mechanics of how we get that money which I take issue with. Doing it by raising fees, while probably easier to do politically, add to administration costs for very little actual benefit. (after all, whats 6% of 0.75%)

Raising taxes might be harder, but can potentially net much more into the system without directly aiming at the pockets of the worse off amongst us.

I think the common framing of poor people pay vs doctors get paid poorly neglects that it doesn't have to come out of either bucket and is just not very helpful to solving the problem.

Nyan2Neko,"i caught a fever for almost a week until my parent realised its something worst, my dad said my face looked like i actually bout to die. They took me to the hospital emergency, but they couldnt find a ward for me, the hospital was full. The emergency room were filled with patient queing, waiting for a ward. We called all hospitals around Selangor/KL that night but there was not a single ward available, talk bout bad luck.

My parents thought bout taking me to a private hospital, only to be told later by the staff they rearranged their patients to get me a 'room'. Turns out its just a bed at the clinics. I was in a different section of the hospital, away from the actual wards. They stationed some extra nurses to manage the newly added 'ward'. Stayed for 3 weeks until i finally discharged.

I remember seeing a facebook post of people saying how cluttered our government hospital with patients laying on a bed outside of the actual wards. I was one of them, and boy I'm glad I'm one of them. I am thankful for them not rejecting me and I really feel like they actually tried their best on giving the best healthcare for us. Not a single patients were rejected that time, as far as i can see.

To add a little bit more, not really bout healthcare system but more like act of kindness I saw during my stay. I got to stay at the actual ward the last few days i was hospitalised, a lot of patients were discharged. There was an uncle, his bed was in front of mine. He had a throat and lung problem. Paru-paru berair his son said to me. Both problem caused him unable to talk, if he talk, he felt suffocated. The son took him to private before but no improvement what so ever (I have no intention to bash private healthcare, in fact before this I only went to private healthcare because my father's work supported it).

During that one morning of doctor check up, the doc which i later found out he was a specialist surgeon, talked to him (I wasnt really listening to their conversations), and suddenly asked the nurse to prepare stuff. He did a surgery on the spot, and what do ya know, uncle can talk again. He was crying and showing his gratitude to the doc, and he even said, the mini surgery free of charge, belanja. I dont have a word to describe the moment here, other than feeling so gay for the doc, such a korean hero move xD.

We're severely understaffed. Take a visit to your local General Medical ward and notice how full it is, and take a look at the faces of those who are treating each and one of those patients.

You're getting suboptimal care due to staff burnout.

Mysrique,"Stayed 3 days in private for dengue, lost consciousness halfway through day 2. I was incredibly fortunate to get a spot in the GH because during transfer, severe dengue reared its head and I went into multiple organ failure. Hopes were not high when they received me. If I never got the transfer, I'd be dead.

Kidneys had failed, so I was on 24/7 dialysis for several days while under medically induced coma as they performed fairly harsh procedures to save my life. Even when I came to, I've seen so many machines wheeled to my bedside that if it was in a private hospital, I'd be looking at a lifetime of debt.

Spent 35 days in that ICU, got multiple dialyses, ultrasounds (when an artery/vein, I'm not sure, burst from the stress), stitches, 3 blood transfusions and round the clock care from nurses. Walked out of there alive, with a medical bill of RM 500.

I cannot express how grateful I am for everything I got there. Sure, they can be slow when it's not life threatening, but when it matters, they really deliver the best they can. 10/10 will trust again.

I shared my story many time here, hereditary kidney disease since i was 12 with progression to total kidney failure at 15. Dialysis for 13 year until 2 year ago when i got my kidney transplant. The only moment i out of the goverment system is when i gone overseas for my transplant and short while in a local private insitution(about 2 week). After that i'm back to goverment system until now where i'm in costant check in goverment hospital.

Price i paid? 13 ringgit for checkup and 13 ringgit for each time i dialysis on goverment clinic. Not bad if i'm in american system i would have never lived past 15 year old. Dialysis would have cost malaysian 250 ringgit per dialysis, and that is cheap.

Felinomancy,"First of all, I'm biased; my mom was a nurse at the general hospital. So it always appeared to me that in the rare occasions that I had to go there, I got good treatment. I don't know if it's because that's the way it is or because my mom pulled a few strings.

So let's get to the cons first:

* it can be chaotic sometimes in the place. 

* the wait time is atrocious

But on the plus side:

* it's hella cheap. I went to the Putrajaya Hospital for dengue treatment, and got charged RM1. I wondered why they even bothered

* it works. It's not the most luxurious of places, but yeah the treatments work

I'll end this with a personal anecdote: one time, I had to go for a minor surgery in a gomen hospital, and being the clueless guy that I am, I used the nearest ""entrance"" that I can see.

,"I was never hospitalised in my entire life, and the occasional visits I made to clinics was because I needed MC.

Since my extended family is moderately well-off, we usually went to private hospitals. Some are very good, like KPJ Ampang Putri, filled with specialists, others are only after your money, like Gleneagles.

But speaking from experience, I had an immediate family member who has this very uncommon skin condition. We went to seek treatment from one of the best private hospital in Singapore. To our astonishment, the head specialist for dermatology recommended a specialist doctor from GH in KL, as this person was very well known in this field. So we went to GH and did the treatment, and all it costed was RM 5. But that's not the most astonishing part. The most astonishing part was that how many specialists who are leaders in their field are working in the government. Since then I had a newfound respect for government medical service provider.

And since a lot of members of my extended family are doctors, some of whom are specialists themselves, they know each other. They went to each others' children's weddings. Their children went to medical school together. Most of them work in the government, or at least that's where they polish their skills before going private.

Anyway I just wanna say if you go to gov hospitals you will be well taken care of. I have no doubts about that. It's just the waiting time is atrocious and some of the facilities look outdated. Our health expectancy and infant mortality rate is already at first world level, and that with the all the leakages running around. The fact that we manage that proves that we have very good professionals working in the gov. Imagine what we could do with more money and less overworked staffs?

Anyway I don't get all this hate against our NHS. Fuck these twats. Maybe they'll rethink their position when it's life/death situation on them. But I get it. Seems fashionable these days to hate anything malay or gov related.",2017-12-19 18:33:59,public health,,reddit

Had a referral letter for my ankle joints, when to the hospital, couldn't find my around since I never been referred to a hospital . Information desk was useless, she gave me this sour face and ask angrily if this is my first in hospital. I said yes, and she lazily gave me the direction to the place I've meant to go. Went to the nurse in charge to register my appointment, she was not busy or anything,but like the other seems so angry when I ask for an appointment, gave her the referral letter and told me appointment is in this date and don't be late. 

When it was time for  appointment, things was completely different, nurse in charge was absolutely nice told me the procedure of payment (since I'm private sector employee) and where the doctor is with politeness and respect. Doctor was very young and supervised by a professor, but he did his work calmly and proffessionally, with the prof correcting him to do additional checks. Did multiple x-rays, again department for that was absolutely helpful and  polite saying i have to wait a whole because there is a patient that needs it more urgently, so on. 

After checks on X-rays, doctor just say it is very stressed muscle  from twisting it and should heal gradually, advise not to walk alot but try swimming. 

Paid total of around RM 200 for the visit and multiple X rays. Not bad, won't mind using government hospital doctors again. Admin wise needs improvement.

jihahahahad,"Personal experience:

I was referred to the Primary Care at UMMC by my private GP, so I went there twice. Waiting times can be quite long, be prepared to spend 2-3 hours waiting, but the nurses and doctors are very nice and accommodating, considering the amount of people that they see everyday. If you don't have a prior appointment, bring your IC and come by 7:30 to take number, the orderly at the queue number dispenser will explain how it works :)

RM5 for one consultation, so paid a total of RM10. Doctors and nurses were very efficient too!

Other's experience:

My grandfather was admitted to UMMC, he was warded for about 3 weeks in the old block. With X-rays, tests, treatment etc, the total came up to less than 1200 or so - rm1000 was for the CT scan, 200 was for *everything else*. The doctors and nurses are alright but sometimes appear get flustered when you ask them questions which I guess is understandable. On my grandfather's ward, a full Professor would make rounds 2-3x a week, and there always would be specialists making rounds twice a day. 

The rooms are not like the Ritz-Carlton at all, 2 to a room, with no TV, and patients are not allowed to charge items in the rooms because of fire risks, so I'm not sure how the arrangement would be like if you have a phone - my grandfather is org zaman dinosaur, so he uses an ancient Nokia that he bother bringing.

mistar_z,"When I was like ten or something I had to get surgery from an accident that left a sowing needle in my foot. Hopped on from one district hospital into another when their surgeon couldn't get the foreign object out. The first hospital didn't have a surgeon at the time open my foot up for it, so they got me transferred to the next town over and they got me in minor awake surgery as soon as I arrived in the emergency room and gotten the xray.

They did the surgery but couldn't locate the needle. So they ordered for me to get the surgery at the old ~~Queef~~ Queen Elizabeth hospital in KK where they have better equipment in the morning (2-3 hours away?). Stayed there for over a day if I remember correctly before the surgery, in a general patient's area. The doctors and nurses were really cool to me and were helpful when my dad wasn't with me overnight to get paperwork and insurance stuff back where we lived.

Made a friend with a really cool boy. Really connected with him, for one I could actually find another kid who I could talk space stuff, science and string theory about. Never did find anyone like him again though. :/ 

Met and consulted with the doctor who'd be doing my surgery, a young and very dreamy Indian doctor. Who assured me I'd be in good hands with him and the team. Day of the surgery came and it was time to get into the hospital gown, I was very nervous and the nurses helped me get in it making light conversation and complimenting me about how long my prick was for my age (on another occasion where I had to get naked for an unrelated the doctor also talked about the the size, know why they do this lols) and wheeled me in into the operating room after saying goodbye to my dad. 

It was legit terrifying seeing how big some of the machines were especially this big thumb they wheeled in that had like four TV screens on it. Post surgery th doctor caught up with me, talking about how it went and I'm feeling and what to aspect. Stayed for two nights recovering as they monitor me and keep me happy with some happy drugs. Because when they did found the needle they discovered it had broken to three pieces instead of the previous which was believed to only be two pieces. They never did found the third piece that was supposed to be the end that penetrated me, even after getting more xrays done. 

Had other experiences with my mum and brother also going to hospitals from anything to a routine check up to a dislocated elbow (we were a rough bunch), and so far it has all been very positive. The doctors and nurses treated us with respect and kindness, and a doctor showed great consideration when we had to meet up with a specialist after the other QEH' doctor had to go on an emergency delivery and they got us to go to QEH2. 


I think of stuff that I read off come from shitty desk jobs with poor hourly or shit management, that's probably why they're just so bitchy most of the time.

I had a symptom of having back pain that was REALLY PAINFUL, it was pulsating like fuck and I couldn’t sleep at all at night. Doctor thought I could be urinary tract infection which apparently has the same symptom. 1.5 weeks gone and nothing changed. By that time I was already at 4 weeks before college.

By 5pm, when the results were in, it was confirmed two stones, one each on my ureters. The doctor said the stones were big enough that they were putting pressure to my kidneys as the urine couldn’t go through. I was alone but the KPJ Hospital was 3km away. Only at 6pm my parents came and have further chat with the doctor.

Long story short, 10am in the next morning, I went into the surgery room and I saw this long ass super fucking thick epidural needle that I had to take at my spine. My heart almost stopped that time.

,"As an expat coming from a high cost of living country in Europe: on an average Malaysian salary you can afford to eat out a few times a month. Sure, not necessarily in a fancy restaurant, but you can go to mamak or kopitiam every now and then. You also don't have to worry so much about energy costs. Petrol is cheap, even considering the much lower average salary. As is electricity. Energy costs in general are low and in Europe worrying about heating in winter is a real struggle for many people, while the weather and energy costs make it a non-issue here.

That being said Malaysia has free health care, for many expats quite affordable private health care, good internet speeds and mobile coverage, high end shopping malls, a halfway decent public transportation system (which admittedly could be better!) and a lot of reasonably well maintained parks. Air quality is acceptable for most of the year,  even in KL where it is much worse than the rest of the country. It's really not that bad for a large city. Furthermore it's a fairly harmonic population. Sure, there are struggles and political agendas trying to cause divide, but the reality is that for most people this really doesn't matter in their daily lives. You see malays, chinese,  indians and westerners sit together at the same table at a mamak in the morning. If you go to east Malaysia the racial/religious harmony is on another level yet again.

We're basically earning 'similar' to what we would back home in Oz _and_ converted to local currency, but paying local prices.

The quality of life overseas is greatly dependant on your income level. All that infrastructure usually comes with high taxation and higher costs of living. 

A 6 figure salary after taxes isn't much in most major cities that's expats hail from. Even worse if they have kids. 

KL has infrastructure that's closer or equivalent to major NA/EURO/developed countries than most would imagine. Especially versus other SEA nations except Singapore.

Based on my experience over the last 4 years back, the numbers support why Malaysia is considered a LCOL. For example, my monthly burn in KL is 70-80% lower vs my last NA city with the equivalent or better quality of life. 

Combine that with relatively low violent crime rates, tropical weather and being less prone to natural disasters, accessibility of high quality affordable health care, low cost travel options and close vicinity to popular destinations, more favourable tax rates etc - Malaysia hits the sweet spot.

,"Singaporean here who frequents Malaysia. 

In my view, Malaysia actually has amazing infrastructure, standard of healthcare, services, even supply chain wise you can get pretty much any international brands extremely easily here (speaking specifically with my limited experience in KL/Selangor). 

But cost of living is by no means cheap here. For a median local salary I would say lifestyle wise a lot of my younger colleagues there spend quite conservatively on average. The gap is pretty huge for someone who works up the ladder here, vs someone who does business here (it's a market that's great for small businesses or investments but that's a whole other topic) or works in a company with business primarily in USD or other currency so of course salary wise it calibrates up. 

The only ones who find it cheap are the above 2 camps locally, as well as expats, who of course drive prices up (supply/demand, everyday you up price the foreigners still find it cheap due to exchange, of course you up more, but then it impacts locals). 

So yes, quality of life good yes, not to mention land is big, human talent is high, you can build nice houses, own nice things, but cost of living is really not cheap, speaking even as a Singaporean.

,"From the outside looking in from Singapore, I can make a few hypotheses.

Compared to The Philippines and Indonesia, Malaysia has a much more favourable infrastructure challenge (island chains are forever going to have infrastructure headaches until we invent teleportation) and lower population relative to natural resources. The extreme example of this at work is Brunei: small population relative to natural resources.

Likewise compared to Thailand, Malaysia has a smaller population to support.

Compared to Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia, much less Myanmar, Malaysia is a lot more open as an economy.

While standards of English is not comparable to Singapore or India or The Philippines, quite a number of professionals are trained in the UK because of the colonial legacy, as well as other English speaking countries. That's where the private healthcare doctors come from.

While I can understand that many Malaysians are struggling, they should keep in mind that if they were in the Philippines and work for a multinational company, they might still only have a wooden house. The fact that a lot of Malaysians have moved into concrete houses and there aren't slums in every city, is a massive step in development.",2023-08-25 13:49:40,cost of living,,reddit

,"The objective truth is that the infrastructure in Malaysia is actually quite good, especially if you're in major cities like KL and Penang. Service quality is also generally very well.  


Now, normally this would equate to higher cost of living, but we then managed to artificially suppress this by having   
1. crazy blanket subsidies - fuel, staple food items are all price controlled, the actual CoL is pretty much tanked by the government which is why inflation is causing this to eat into gov budgets and they are trying to reduce it now to ""save the country""  
2. low wages - if wages are high, businesses are simply going to charge more, increasing CoL  
3. weak currency - only applies to foreign currency earners, as they are earning USD/EUR, everything will look cheap when converted to MYR  


While you may call it a sweet spot, it's an unfortunate fact that the government is spending way too much on subsidies, and that most Malaysians do not feel that the cost of living is low due to low wages in the country despite the subsidies.  


When expats move to Malaysia, they are also paid based on their home country level, imagine the kind of lifestyle that 5000USD can bring if you are spending in MYR. If you have high pay and still get subsidies, life is just gonna be awesome  


There are some data that can put that into perspective if we look at [https://www.worlddata.info/cost-of-living.php](https://www.worlddata.info/cost-of-living.php)   
Malaysia costs 64.8% less than US, while earning about 85% less  
Meanwhile our favourite comparison, SG costs almost 30% less than US, while earning about 12% less. objectively speaking, life would be better in SG if you earn the average local salary

QoL is the key factor here, you can go anywhere in Malaysia by driving, which is better QoL than taking public transport, and you can eat out pretty often at decently nice place.

,"Don't really agree with the contribute more to the system, take more mentality especially when in comes to petrol subsidy.   


Tax is government's revenue and the government should put the people's interest first, especially those who are in need, poverty and the such. That's why the public school, hospital system is in place. That's why you have all these 'government handouts' to help those who need it, and is earning less than a certain amount. Its meant to be used to help those in need and as a 'catchup mechanic' to equalise the gap between the richest and poorest. IMO, really disagree with this win-more mentality when it comes to petrol subsidy. The T20 reaped more than 20% of the petrol subsidy. Over 35% of the petrol subsidy is channeled to T20. While only 24% went to B40. What makes this even worse is the fact that B40 is probably only using what is absolutely neccessary to survive, and using motorbike, or low petrol consumption vehicle while T20 is using hilux, driving big nice cars, going on road trips, going on joy ride, all of which is not strictly neccessary.   


Everyone pays the same for public transport, and stands to reap the same amount of benefit. Everyone pays the same for hospital and schools and stands to reap the same amount of benefit. But somehow for petrol subsidy, the rich get to benefit out of it more than everyone?",2023-08-26 08:17:11,cost of living,,reddit

,"I'll make a few comparisons of my husband's experience since he has lived in the US his entire life. We live in an already low COL state.

Dental: Tooth extraction was a horrible experience for him. His gum swelled for days and how much it cost you say? Well, it's a guessing game. The range is between $170 to $700. The front desk won't tell you but they will surprise you with an insane bill. In this case, he guessed wrong. What he thought $60, it was $250. On a separate occasion, he had an injury around his gums which require surgery. That cost him $9000 with insurance. When I took him to see my dentist in Malaysia, she said ""your doctor did his best"" lol. He is getting all the care needed from her with GOOD quality and he would know the cost even before getting it done. I got 5 of my teeth extracted with zero swelling for RM200 from my dentist. Another note, Americans go to Mexico for dental work.

General medical care: Our general practitioner straight up told us to get medical check up in Malaysia. If that's not a bad sign of how horrible is the America's healthcare system I don't know what is. Malaysian doctors we've met always emphasize longevity. US doctors we met just want to suck out money from us since they earn commission from selling pharmaceutical drugs. (Watch the Painkiller on Netflix for more info)

Salon/Barber/Spa: Malaysian barbers and salon workers give very VERY good service. Unlike US, we are given snacks, massage and we're not obligated to pay them tips. 

Restaurants: Eating out is EXPENSIVE here with very limited options and again, you are also obligated to tip them. Usually, the foods are overated and why should I tip you for handing me a cupcake? Malaysian restaurants have to compete with not just other restaurants but also with warung2 so Malaysians are presented with way more options.

,"Let me give you some insight as someone who basically grew up in this environment. For starters, the wealth inequality gap in Malaysia is huge. I can think of 2 reasons as to why children in Malaysia are like this: 1) peer pressure and 2) rich parents. 

I had private schooling. My friends and I barely spoke Malay and Chinese... and preferred English instead (you know the drill). We were immensely Westernised from a young age. And what happens when you're Westernised? Well, you follow Western trends and are infatuated with Western media, of course. You watch influencers on the internet possessing certain brands that are, in fact, expensive to the average Malaysian (because they're in USD, GBP, EUR, etc.); nonetheless, you're convinced! Your friends in school start wearing and using such brands too. And if you don't follow the masses, you're looked at weirdly. Students gossip behind your back about the possibility of you being poor (or just poorer than them). So you beg your parents. And they eventually listen and give in to your demands. 

I can give you a few examples. My Year 7 class had a mixture of students. I'd say 30% had Android phones, and 70% had iPhones. However, at the end of Year 9 (3 years later)... I think the ratio changed to: 5% to 95%? Why? Peer pressure. iPhones are much cooler in the eyes of Gen Z.

Another example... when I started A Levels at Sunway College, I wore a basic pair of Sketchers. But soon enough, I made my mum go to JD and buy me some Vans or Converse. Why? Well, I noticed how my classmates (and just people at Sunway in general) looked at my feet weirdly. It was a humiliating experience, to say the least.

I also began to care more about brands when I went shopping for clothes. Soon, appearance became everything. I even dyed my hair a lighter colour just because many others were doing it. 

And a final example - everyone in Sunway had an iPad!! At least in my class. I made my mum get me an iPad because I was known as the ""only kid in class who didn't have an iPad."" People snickered behind my back.

Now, look... I'm actually considering deleting this comment a while later because I know people are going to call me spoiled. I'm aware that my demands were unreasonable. But peer pressure is peer pressure. Please do not reply with all that corny, ""Ohhh, you shouldn't care what others think!!""

And finally, I head to my second point - rich parents. A lot of my friends have incredibly wealthy parents. They are usually entrepreneurs. Some are doctors, lawyers, accountants, and whatnot. But most are involved in business, I think. And some earn from overseas. I think this explains why Malaysians can afford many (foreign) expensive brands. I had this couple in my class who drove me in their Mazda to the mall after classes one day to hang out. The girl told me how her mum owned factories overseas. (The couple even flew to Japan out of the blue a few weeks before our exams because they were ""stressed."") One of my best friends told me her mother worked as an accountant overseas for years before she came back to Malaysia to start a business. My sister’s best friends are crazy rich, too. Pools in their backyards, multiple TVs in their cars, spending money on things like PS5s (yes, when the PS5 came out in Malaysia, my sister’s best friend bought it on the same day without even asking his parents). Basically, rich parents enable their children to be this way. My classmates bought K-pop concert tickets IN CLASS without discussing it with their parents first. When we'd go out to eat, they'd pay no attention to the prices. When we planned on activities like bowling, archery, or escape rooms... no one mentioned prices. I can go on and on with many more examples, but I'll stop here.

Essentially, many of my friends are very inconsiderate of how the less fortunate live their lives. They are really out of touch with reality. Even teachers in our school would be scared of the students sometimes; a student saying, ""I'll tell my parents,"" would send shivers down their spines.",2023-12-19 13:36:25,cost of living,,reddit

,"Here's the insight: Observer bias.

Consider this:

* T20 is still a pretty substantial group. Assuming a population of 33 million, that top 20% is roughly...6.6 million? I know the definition is classified by household and not by the individual but it's a fair gauge. I think people also overestimate how much it takes to be classified as T20, but that only highlights the huge disparity between the top 1% to 5% with the rest of the population. But I digress.
* Since you mentioned TRX, you're probably in the Klang Valley, where the majority of the nation's wealth is concentrated. Naturally, your chances of encountering the wealthy is going to be higher, especially if you're observing more expensive brands. Bad example but someone who's already in the market for an Apple product probably isn't gonna shop for a Vivo or Oppo. The RM300k cars you're referring to are, once again, from observing in Klang Valley.
* Like it or not, we have a shopping mall culture and within it - a lot of people window shop, but it doesn't mean they're actually spending their money. Remember when The Exchange TRX opened, it was insanely crowded? People just want to check out a fancy new mall (or heck, enjoy the air-conditioning), it doesn't mean they're spending. Plus there were all those people complaining about the parking rates - all I can say about that is if they're complaining about the cost of parking, they're probably not the target audience of the mall (also it's pretty well-connected with the MRT).

Also I hate to be the person to say this but RM100k-ish cars here can't really be classified as ""luxury"", but you'd be surprised at the number of people who live by the skin of their teeth and take 9-year loans just to get a nicer car because the financial system allows it.",2023-12-18 13:41:43,cost of living,,reddit

I always ask myself and my wife this question, how are the younglings finding the money to have RM 30 to RM 50 breakfast or lunch or coffee per pax, when I see those ""insta"" places full with kids who are obsessed with selfies and not even chatting. 

I'm not from B40 as per OP background, but I do come from a moderate background. Now I'm in a rather comfortable spot at 39, I spend the things I want to spend but even at my income level, i feel the pinch. No comments on the shopping part as I do mostly online, and my only splurge is either tech stuff or watches.

I truly believe the younger gen and those u see spending are going this few ways, to my knowledge:

1) might be making money from insta being a ""influencer"",alot of this low ranges ones make money from wealth men. Either being party girls, part time gf or even OF. New gen, new mindset when the only thing u can sell is this.

2) Malaysia is a hot bed for illegal activities, scam centers, online gambling, illegal loanshark so the ppl funding the younglings might be this or themselves

3) parents rich or kids just spending future money because now kids don't have the mentality to buy a property etc, the old school way. YOLO life, they just live by the days.

4) This is KL, where majority of wealth is accumulated here assuming 95% of the T20 recide and spend in the same place. It's not that people are rich, just that rich people all are here so there is a distorted reality.",2023-12-20 15:46:10,cost of living,,reddit

Since BMW is among the earliest automaker launching EV's in Malaysia, I paid a lot of attention on BMW EV's running around the road of KL.

How many T20, or T1 if you may, we have in this city that can sustain the business of BMW dealership? I have not yet to touch upon other makers like Merc, Volvo and etc. This observation focus specifically on big ticket items.

Fnb i just think people buy those anyways because its not seen as a big spend? Not sure on that but rm20 for a cup of coffee is ridiculous.

Cars, its just to showoff i believe. Nobody in my opinion should go for luxury cars unless they have a constant source of finances which is stable and gives enough surplus to sustain the maintenance of such cars (exception to only Lexus and certain Toyota models).

Maybe some are from rich families, wondering how a college student haven't even start working can spend so much? or maybe some work and save up to buy what they want, is fine. But in some cases, some of them get salary and spend most of it every month, and end up less saving for them. is either you want to save more or spend more, except if you are born rich. Some people i know, spend like crazy but in actual they do not have saving. Some spend wisely, wear and eat normal, probably cook most of the time to save up, only spend what is necessary, maybe once in awhile spend what they want. They have enough saving to the point that, they don't have to worry about 1 - 3 years of being jobless, and still have the money to pay loan, etc..

This is a bias due to sample selection and do not accurately reflect the population.   
Depending on where you are, there's always selection bias in the kind of people you see/ interact with.   


If you're in a fancy mall near an area where property prices are sky high, chances are, the people that will be there are those that have the means to spend rm20 for a cup of coffee everyday. Maybe they are in debt, maybe they truly do have the means to do so, it doesn't matter, the type of people staying in these area are the people who are WILLING to spend RM20 for a cupt of coffee.   


This goes for everything. If you visit the local wetmarket in a neighbourhood that aren't wealthy, then you will see people being very frugal, calculative and the market also reflects that by selling at the lowest possible price to cather to the local demographic. Similarly, in a wealthy neaighbourhood, the market will instead be air-conditioned, filled with imported goods, and the vegetables, meats and so on may even be pre-cut.   


The average median Malaysia can't spend RM20 on a cup of coffee everyday, that is a fact, no matter what you see or hear. Especially don't listen to the boomers saying things like 'youngsters these days can't afford to buy houses or get married because they are spending RM20 every day on coffee."" That is just demonstrably false. This generation can't afford houses or get married or build a family is due to stagnant wages, on top of inflation and rising cost of living as well as significantly increased price of property ON TOP of increasing need for specialisation in pretty much all industry needing at minimum a tertiary education for any job that pays decently well.

I haven’t lived in Malaysia for over 10 years but in 2009 shortly before I left I recall every single one of my friends carrying a CC balance. 

Min pay on 10,000 is 250/month. If you can spare 500/ mth on frivolous spending; putting it on a CC allows you to spend 20k. 

Pretty easy to buy into the idea that a 20k bag actually cost 500/ mth 😋.

,"**On coffee**

Actually, Rm20 x 30 days a month is RM600. That's <10% for the median household in KL, Putrajaya, Selangor. So I'm going to counter your stand and say, the median household in Klang Valley actually **CAN** spend RM600 a month on coffee. A couple would probably share that same cup, though. :P

**On housing**

The median house in Selangor 2022-2023 is about RM500k. That makes a housing affordability of about 4.8-5x annual median household income of RM120k

So, I'm going to counter that and say, yes, the fresh graduate probably cannot buy a house. But a young couple, both with 5 years experience making 5-6k a month each? No issue affording a house, just whether you could get one in the place you want.

,"Hmm.. I get how you feel but you can't compete with your course-mates. They might have a different life like yours. I also used to think that negatively but now I'm more open-minded maybe my maturity grows along with my age. How can they afford it, probably a few things.   
1. They didn't post how much they work their asses off and managed to get a thick bonus from their company, so finally deserve their holiday with their thick bonus to spend on.   
2. Starting up already decided the fate (i.e. born in a rich family), have their own family business and your course mate might be taking over one day of the family business(es).  
3. Even if they are not from rich families, somehow manage to get someone to pay for their trip. (Family pay, siblings, husband-to-be/ boyfriend, or worst sugar daddy (for female))  
4. Roll up their debts with their credit card and pay the minimum amount, or get money/loan from a bank (personal loan) or a loan shark (there are still people out there who are like that)  
5. Finally, working hard in a different industry also has different treatment (i.e. working hard as a normal admin staff or a blue-collar job VS working in the insurance/banking industry or property agents, etc. because their bonuses are thick but their basic are low.

,"To be honest, my family had a humbling experience back during the pandemic (I was still in school, not in Sunway College yet). I won't go too into it because it's kinda personal (let's just say business went south) but basically it made me realise how privileged we lived. At some point, it got so bad that my mum's brother (for context, he's a U.S. citizen) lent us some money back then to keep things rolling until we got back on our own two feet. (It wasn't *much* of a burden for him since, you know, USD to MYR conversion rates. But we owe him nonetheless.)

Anyway, it's the reason why I can step back and analyze all this. If not for my humbling experience, I'd probably still be just as inconsiderate and ignorant as my friends/classmates today. I know it. I wouldn't even have read your post because it wouldn't have concerned me. I'm legit serious. And, by the way, I don't blame them or loathe them or anything.

,"Coffee <10% of median household income.

  
 A typical household consist of 3 -4 person based on statista, probably lower in urban area.Let's just assume a typical median household consists of 2 income earner, usually the father&mother, or a couple. Based on OpenDOSM, the Median household income as of 31 dec 2022 data is only RM10k. So, RM600 is more than 10% of what a single median income earner would earn. While, yes RM600 is <10% of the median household income, if its between two income earner, and both have the same habit, thats RM1,200 a month just on coffee alone. They **CAN,** but is it something people would want to engage in actively? **I also said average median malaysian, not median Klang Valley Malaysian.** In the very same list in the attached image, you can see the moment you look at median household income of outside Selangor/KL/Putrajaya, which is where the majority of the Malaysian are, there's a huge falloff, to only having RM6-7k median household income. So RM20 coffee everyday is well within 10% of household income of an average median Malaysian. That's just 1 persons's daily coffee habit taking up almost 10% of the **household** income.  


> The median house in Selangor 2022-2023 is about RM500k. That makes a housing affordability of about 4.8-5x annual median household income of RM120k

You are ignoring loan interest, and also daily expenditure whilst paying for the RM500k house. Assuming you took a loan of RM400k @ 3% interest (impossibly low) , paying off RM100k as a lump sum/ down payment (which already requires 1 or more year to save up), with a loan repayment period of 15 - 30 years, your monthly mortgage is RM1.6k - RM2.7k. At 10k median household income, that is 16-27% of the household monthly income paid off to mortgage. Whatever I wrote here is most likely an underestimate as well, and so many thing has to fall right in order to make it work. We haven't even talked about cost of transport, food, water, eletricity, and so on, and 16-27% of the monthly household income is already gone. Transport being a big one, since the entirety of Malaysia including klang valley is so car centric, hence a car is already a big burden in terms of cost. Again, they can do it, but how likely is it that the property is both decent and in a viable location and only RM500k, having a partner who earns RM5k+ whilst being a RM5k+ earner, a low interest property loan.   


Personally, I think its a very low chance and does not truly reflect the average median Malaysian. We also haven't even include the possibility of needing to support siblings, parents/ grandparents who are old and etc etc. The **household** income can support buying a house, but thats after pooling multiple sources of income, mostly 2 source, sometimes even more, rarely only a single source, and with the assumption that there is no other prior commitment or pressing expenses like car, education, insurance, emergency fund, etc etc.

,"Actually your observation isn’t that outrageously erroneous also tbh. I know a lot people that are actually M40 that spend as if they are T20.

The situation you see of ppl spending gila2 is mostly from M40 trying to keep up appearances because they didn’t do as well as their T20 friends. Sometimes it’s hard to accept that we didn’t “make it” and continue to hyper focus on the T20 friends that did, when we forget to look down to appreciate what we achieved. Ppl always want more. They overspend.

Btw if you want really cheap stuff just shop on Shopee, my shoes cost RM 50 but design inspired by Adidas ultra boost without the adidas branding. Then I buy extra insole (RM 5) to make the fit snug and healthier for my feet. It feels better than my original Ultra Boosts (RM 799)

,"Sounds like your age is not really in the middle part yet (i.e. probably mid or late 20s only, or probably going to finish your studies). Wait till you reach around the late 30s or come to 40+, you will get what I mean, you might think that they are rich and live life lavishly as such, but there are always 2 sides to the story. So never doubt it, just live within your means. For Example, friends of mine worked hard at an early age and earned 5-figure salaries in their mid-30s and high positions at an early age. It is impressive, but do you know how much pressure they are facing, and with one wrong move, the management or others can get him removed/replaced? Especially if you are a married man, you are even more worried because you still have lots of mouths to feed and things to pay. Sitting at the top, there are lots of wolves in the office waiting to bring the person down. (i.e. office politics, either you are shoe polishing with no skills, or you are a lone wolf with skills but couldn't mingle with others, and trust me, some bosses somehow like their staff to kiss ass but don't know much about work because in the end, is the lower levels who get the jobs done)  
Another thing you should know, when you are in your 20s, people like to discuss what they are doing, where to stay, travel and eat, and which girl they are going after, what car to buy. People in their 30s normally will talk about how successful their career is, how much they spent to get a place (house/condo), finally marrying who they like/love, and starting up a family. But one thing they neglected is their health and stress plays a critical issue in their daily life. In the 40s, you will start to hear negative news of those you once knew who are bedridden due to health issues, or even sudden death (don't get me wrong, I'm not cursing anyone, but if you follow the news, people just suddenly drop death without warning nowadays) (also, I'm not selling insurance/asking you to write a will). Just to let you know one thing you need to take care of your health. Do not ever neglect that and think that I'm young and I can work late, drink beer, or smoke.

,"Not good financial habit, sure, but spending 5-6% of a family's household income on coffee is definitely doable (highly unwise, but doable) to the median household in KV earning RM9-10k a month.

Anyway, to digress, I went down the rabbithole and discovered some interesting tidbits.

**The average msian drinks 107 cups of coffee**

>Source:  [https://bebasnews.my/2023/10/01/interactive-malaysia-has-3rd-highest-coffee-consumption-spike-in-region/](https://bebasnews.my/2023/10/01/interactive-malaysia-has-3rd-highest-coffee-consumption-spike-in-region/)  
>  
>On average, every person in the country drank 52 cups of coffee in 2017.  
>  
>But this number has more than doubled, or swelled by 105% to **107 cups per person a year in 2021.**  
>  
>This is based on an analysis by Sunday Star on the data from the ICO on coffee consumption and the country’s total population from the World Bank.  
>  
>The number of cups are then calculated based on each cup using 10 grams of coffee.

&#x200B;

**Malaysia's Starbucks has annual sales of RM884m, equivalent to RM25 per citizen  (33m population, and about 8million households), or RM100-110 per household. Assuming starbucks has 50% market share (my assumption), this works out to be about Rm200-250 total coffee spend per household per year.**

**So clearly, people are NOT spending RM600 on coffee a month (RM7,200 a year on coffee).**

What kind of nasi kandar u taking? Fried chicken, vege, rice easily 8.50. If not 9bucks if you round off. So don’t pretend like there isn’t one that exist in klang valley.

Also that’s cuz I’m not ridiculous enough to purposely find a far ass place to work and commute through the jam. I already weighed these probable outcomes and plan ahead. I do have to commute but not far enough to be difficult for myself. 

Plus, your pay is 1.5k. Then I’m gonna tell you that you have no choice but to squeeze every bit you can. To live within your means. If not find a higher paying job. I don’t personally don’t buy groceries anymore as eating out saves more at this point btw. And also depends where you choose to eat. There are so many places that food can be cheap. Economy rice, plain hawker stalls. 

In conclusion, your pay is this much. Then you’re gonna have to sacrifice a lot of things. If YOU personally chose a slightly lower paying job that wants you to commute so damn far, that was YOUR choice. And not a very wise choice to begin with.

,"Sorry I mean to say reduced by 6 or 7 per day by not getting an extra drink 3x a day

Personally I spend RM3/4 on nasi lemak/roti canai+tampal breakfast, 6 to 8ish on lunch (3 if I decide to eat nasi lemak for lunch), dinner if I eat out max 9 (rarely), usually 7/8 for some nasi goreng variant, much cheaper to cook.

Rice is cheap af to cook, salad also cheap if you have a fridge, buy a head of romaine lettuce for maybe 3-5 ringgit and it lasts several meals, add some kewpie dressing from a bottle for which lasts for quite some time. If Im lazy to go out sometimes I just eat airfried nuggets, rice, salad for breakfast or dinner. 2 telur mata fried myself + kicap + sos tomato on rice easy filling meal (boiled eggs much easier to make but I don't like them too much). I can't give an exact number because I go shopping for a bunch of ingredients at a time, I have a fridge in my shared house (living with my college mates sharing a room)

,"I'm not really ""low wage"" by any stretch of the imagination. I make about RM7k a month, but because of some bad decisions made in the past and extremely controlling parents, I've been saddled with about RM5000+ in terms of commitments. My wife makes about RM4-5k a month, but has been a housewife on and off for the last few years because despite my financial issues I actually have most of the basic needs covered, so we're only lacking for expenditures in term of luxury and entertainment. But thanks to the baby, finances are a bit more tight so she went back to work.

&#x200B;

1. Shop during sales and promos. We usually buy in bulk on lazada or supermarket sales. Pampers etc I buy 2-3 ctn in one go. Same goes for non perishable stuff, like tissues, wet wipes, detergents etc etc. We use disposable pampers because washing cloth diapers is extremely costly opportunist costs wise. Same goes for baby clothes. If you shop for them in advance during sales, you can save a ton of money. Supermarkets sometimes sell last year's stock for cheaps too, so we sometimes sapu everything (to the delight of the salesgirl). All in all I think we save about 25-35% of associated costs here.
2. Find a doctor who is encouraging of self medication or willing to tell you what medicines to keep in your fridge to minimize trips to see them. Not all problems need the hassle and costs of a doctor visit, but that does not mean you can solve them on your own. Common symptoms such as fever, cough, flu are easily treatable at home, provided you know which medication to buy and their dosage. For those 3, the products I use are Axel Paracetamol 250, Pabron Kids, and Antamin syrup respectively. I also have medications for extreme fever (suppository that can be taken with paracetamol safely), diarrhea and constipation respectively, although I dont remember the names right now.. From experience, dosage instructions given by doctor is more nuanced compared to dosage given by pharmacists. Pharmacists will give a ""by the book"" instruction that will minimize side effects. Doctor will give a bit more nuanced instructions, such as more if the fever is bad, less if not, etc etc. Savings here vary depending on how often your kid gets sick, but I estimate about 60-80% saved, especially if the pediatrician in your area charges a lot.
3. Milk powder is one of the bigger costs in here. I used to use Enfalac which goes for about RM90 per kg, but after the baby started on solids I've been swapping around in an attempt to reduce costs and find a formula that is easier on constipation. So far I've settled on Morinaga which is RM80 per kg, but when he's a bit older I will switch again to Frisolac or Mamil, which is in the RM60-70 per kg range. This is health related so I'm not gonna say the savings %.
4. For day care, it really depends on what your risk tolerance is, and how well you want your child to develop. Send to home based childcare where your kid watches TV all day and does not have much interaction with other kids for cheap, or send to montessori childcare which is more expensive but your child gets a very good learning and development environment (but also more infections, since more kids). I cant advise here, as this is up to your tolerance. Basically, smaller childcare tends to be less effective to help your child develop but is cheaper. Smaller childcare however tends to be better on the disease/infection chances, as there are less kids to bring in and spread viruses/bacteria in there (downside is your kid may be more prone to infections if completely isolated). Also, there's the option of going for unlicensed childcares, which are even cheaper than small childcare, but you run multiple risks there, from potential maltreatment and abuse to negligence leading to death. Same as above, health/safety related so not saying the savings. 
5. I also spend less I suppose. Instead of shopping for clothes three times a year I do it once every 2 years. I eat out a lot less, and take up hobbies that are less expensive. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I dont recommend having kids if you dont have at least RM2000 disposable income (per kid) tho. Some people can manage with much much less of course, but that's the minimum for my kid. If both me and my wife work, we can easily afford everything, but we trade off less time spent with the kid, so less bonding time I suppose.

Kids consumables and medical stuff are inescapable and painful. Now I'm trying to figure out how to make cultured milk (like yakult) homemade lol. 

In terms of education, you can really go cheap (gomen school) or private school. Among private schools there are many different price points now. Personally, I feel like I came out fine from gomen school, but I'm told that the standard has fallen even further nowadays. So it feels like sending kids to a private school is almost a basic requirement to secure their future. 

Food wise we don't have time to cook. So we are looking at meal subscription options. In Chinese they're called ""Bao Huo Shi"". They work out to be <RM20/adult and extremely convenient. Even though the food is meant for 2 pax, we find it sufficient for 2 adults + 2 kids. 

There are now also a lot of zero waste shops where you can buy non perishable groceries and detergents and good prices. You just need to bring your own container. 

For personal entertainment, streaming is fairly cheap. Going to public parks is also free. We take the kids to the park often. If you go to national attractions, like the zoo, there is usually a very discounted price for MyKad or MyKid holders. When my kids get older, I hope to bring them to the jungle. For now, if I bring them I need to carry them, so I can't go very far.

,"you can try palm oil. it has stability at high temps naturally. Unsaturated fats are healthier when they are not processed but their shelf life and cooking temps are then limited. for example cold pressed olive oil is good for dipping breads in or putting on pizza. Its not processed not used to cook so cant handle high temperatures but when not processed is healthier than animal fat.

So using saturated fats to cook is healthier because of temperature. unsaturated fats tend to have temperature limits under 100C and have their distinct flavour. So if your vege oil has a strong flavour and cant handle high heat then its not really processed.

palm oil is mono unsaturated so its in between both oil types. Its never mentioned in any guides i see because of the controversy to the west regarding various issues. So in malaysia filtered cheap palm oil you can buy for 2.50 per L  is the best value, its decently healthy and not processed and not affected by pricing issue. Also after you use it, you can use the used oil as fuel for certain kinds of diesels but not your diesel car if its modern, due to the injector size. Older diesels use a larger injector port while newer cars use a smaller injector port, like real small that the larger molecules will clog it and cost you loads. So if you want to save the environment, sure unsaturated fats are healthy if unprocessed, but used cooking oil can be a source of fuel too, and very potent from testing.

saturated fats by default have higher stable temperatures and dont turn into transfats after they past their limit. They are also stable longer or tend to come in the food we eat so when you cook meat, oil may not be needed since its in the meat. Before the unsaturated oil craze, McD in US used beef fats as their cooking oil and deep fryer. It was cheaper and more economically even environmentally friendly as McD used beef a lot so the fat was also economically to have as well since no point just throwing away the fat.",2022-05-22 16:36:40,cost of living,,reddit

The tldr is that the cost to changing prices is not insignificant, and the information on the ""correct"" price often takes time to transmit to all agents in the economy. So removing GST (which was inbuilt into the display prices), only reduces prices by a proportion that is less than the full 6% amount removed. 

So background inflation continues on as normal, but prices didn't really drop from abolishment of gst, but also govt revenue drops denting its ability to subsidise some key goods - so you have this net negative impact from removing the gst.

Then followed by the cafes when they begin to notice lower walk-in patrons, and then finally the hawkers.

dandydaddy101,"OP how your portfolio looking like? In Design&Build sector your CV should come with your portfolio. They'll probably put 80% of their focus on your portfolio the CV will just be your first impression. I was an archi part 1 grad, worked in a construction company for 6 months and do freelance for 9 month after. I racked up about 70 project during that freelance period. It didn't take me long for me to find new jobs after that. 

Tips:
- do freelance a bit and build your portfolio
- include your QR for your online portfolio in your CV
- master a lot more software BIM especially 
- use Behance or something to display your projects
- dont just focus on archi job scope, since you have experience in PM you should look into other construction sector as well (interior, 3D visualisation, drafting, on site supervision, sales, BIM, QS) architects are jack of all trades they know the basics of all these things just need to learn more on it.

I know part 2 grad are a bit of an overqulification for some of the jobs, but you have to start somewhere. Construction sector is very shit, experience is more valuable than anything else so you need to network a lot. Best of luck OP don't give up. Since you managed to finish Part 2, you'll do fine in any kind of preasure.",2025-04-09 09:03:30,employment trend,,reddit

1. Message someone within the company (find them on LinkedIn), ask them for some advice or even buy them a cup of coffee. Bodek abit and get to know where the pain points are regarding the position you're applying for. Then write a cover letter based on their pain points and how you can help with them. Casually let them know that you are interested in the job and you would appreciate it if they could put in a good word.   
2. Send that cover letter along with a tailored resume (highlighting your key achievements/research experience on their pain point). Then message the hiring manager/recruiter that you have sent in your application, to save them time, write a short summary on what you can do. Offer to meet up and touch bases (Most of the time this will be ignored, but its the thought that counts)  
3. Followup every 3-4 days for about 2 weeks, if you're continuously being ignored, stop.

FutureNotBleak,"In Malaysia we all tend to give off this impression that we’re all nice people and like to help/support each other. It’s fucking bullshit in the work environment because leadership/management is usually filled by weak people who are narcissists, full of their own ego, and love the smell of their shit. They have zero self awareness and think they’re god’s gift to mankind. Nobody cares about what others think, it’s all about how they need to make themselves look good and others suck. Many Malaysians in the senior leadership level and many in the middle management level can go suck a dick and fuck a pineapple. Learn some fucking self awareness and humility for fucks sake. But no, how can they be a better human when they’ve given up their humanity long ago. Many are bullies who probably were bullies in school and never grew up. I wish they would delete themselves because the world would be a much better place without them.

Having said all that, to clarify, when I was first starting out, I was very ambitious and wanted to get ahead fast. I was the first to arrive at the office and the last to leave. I took on any work that was available. I volunteered to take on work where I could make myself visible to senior management and build relationships / network.

My suggestion for your next job is to do a little bit of digging either from online research (e.g., Glassdoor/Indeed/JobStreet employee reviews) or asking questions about what it's like inside during the interview. It could be as straightforward as asking how the company manages its employees' work-life balance/separation/integration, onboarding newbies, training and growth opportunities, etc. - and then you be the judge from there.

I kesian d CEO because this senior was getting away with everything. We used to have daily check ins in d morning and evening, 5 days a week. Got to a point where those check in sessions were interrogations/performance reviews by this senior. 

Check in started off harmless where it was to build team rapport and address any challenges faced. Became ugly when no one could ever question this senior. I mean we could but it would lead to debates followed by a call fr the senior asking 'What is your problem or why you question me in front of everyone"". I went though this a few times but eventually I stopped questioning because it was troublesome having to debate on the phone on why I said this or that in the team check in call. CEO let it be because things were smooth. 

I ended up doing a lot of needless things so that the senior could say his team was productive. I mentioned once that it's pointless work but was guilt tripped by Senior. Others in the team did not dare speak out so I had to go with the flow. 

Then ppl started leaving. One every month. Senior basically bullied these ppl into leaving. Still in denial the senior said good riddance, we better without them. I think CEO could see that he senior was the cause but was in some denial too. One day CEO and senior got into a argument...senior thought as usual he would win...but CEO fired him LOL. 

I am still in this company and things have been great. The cloud that was the senior left and it was a weight off everyone's shoulders.

But one day, I decided that I would like to put my degree to good use and as such, took up a role in medical sales company, a small one, to put my sales skills and knowledge to good use. 

Sadly, this new job which I was so excited about quickly turned into a traumatizing emotional turmoil of an experience as I was abused like a mad man. Here are some examples. 

1. Closed 3 accounts worth approximately RM10,000.00 each only to come back to the office to have the team lead tell me nahh, we’re good. That was RM3,000.00 in commission and 3 weeks of hard work down the drain. Bear in mind, this client was picked out by the team lead herself. They turned it down just cuz they didn’t feel like it. 

2. I made a typo in an email. The boss was so furious he started throwing shit around and slamming doors before making me drive a total of 50+km to apologize to the person I sent the email to in person. Ridiculous if you ask me, it was a non-issue of a typo too. 

Eventually, I just tendered my resignation and bolted the hell outta there. Even scratched it from my resume cuz I dont ever wanna be reminded of the time I spent there.

My job title as per contract is a site engineer so naturally you would assume I would do more field work at a construction site but in reality, I mostly have to deal with but not limited to:

1. Procurement of quotations and price and material comparison.

2. Monitoring our own handyman at various misc. work all around the finished project areas (e.g. defect rectification, cleaning, etc)

3. Checking progress claim prepared by Q.S. 

4. Dealing with various subcontractors in doing other major defect rectification work that the handyman can't do.

5. Monitoring subcontractor's work and record their work hours so their claim tally with ours

and more. 

If the subcontractor's work dragged for too long i.e. after office hours, I am expected to stay back and monitor until they finish the said work and that overtime is not counted because we don't have OT culture. 

Colleagues and managers are unhelpful at times, especially when asked a question about a task at hand, they would just give a vague answer which I described as: better don't answer it at all or giving me a judgmental face when asked because they would think: you should be known this by then when in reality I don't really know what I am suppose to do or how suppose I am going to execute the said task.

Oh did I mentioned Cinaman companies absolutely loathed spoonfeeding? They would rather to shove you a task you totally have no knowledge of or experience and expected you to plan and execute as perfect as the senior staff and you are are on your own. If you get it right, nobody bats and eye but if you did something wrong, they surely will jump on you and make the rest of your day miserable. 

I already decided to leave this godforsaken company and pursuit in other fields other than construction or go full force as a content creator. I already signed up to a few courses in other fields and hopefully it will jump start me to that field.

Limpeh4896,"I had some bad experiences like u, didn't have any of the work family bullshit but my boss straight up honest demand for us to work long hours without any compensation. I study engineering and my internship in a start-up do procurement, design promo materials, site supervisor, R&D, project tender, business proposal, project paperwork, system development, write code, manage kuli, and sometimes have to turun padang do some electrical wiring and piping work. Go to site do work oso I use my own tools. Initially, i always hv to work until midnight to finish my tasks. Then slowly normalise to 10 to 7 or 8 depending on work load. No training for the stuff that I have absolutely no idea about like business proposal because whole company is built on interns. When got project running I will get messages and calls even on weekends. I don't have a time where I can really switch off work related stuff. My work seems like will never complete and until now I still wonder when can get on top of it.

My boss never shouted or raised his voice with any of us, and have been very easy to talk to but sometimes I get text message or phone call from him I get a bit anxiety. He work even more than me, I cannot understand how ppl can keep working without any time off to recover. This job is toxic or not I not sure yet, but I find it very time consuming. 

My ""part time job"" during uni was even worse, working as a bangla supervisor for hotel contractor, everyday rushing, boss shout and threaten all of us to push work progress. During summer breaks i sleep 3 to 4 hours per day because peak season for hotel events. 1 or 2 off day per month. Got high cholesterol from this job in half a year. Suffer a lot from this extremely high stress and toxic job, this boss betul betul got no limits. Treat us like we are not human, and a lot of crazy work practice going on. Hire all illegal workers, threaten to throw them to polis if they don't work faster. Call and scream at us on every tiny mistake of each job, withhold pay, ask us sleep on floor and next day continue work etc. This job let me see the darker side of malaysian society. Worst thing is my boss was holding on to my pay to keep me continue working. After I quit he straight up don't pay me the remainder. Lucky to get out in one piece. Until now i keep my phone on silent bcos when I hear phone ring I hv anxiety attack. 

I have no hope in a career in chinaman SME unless it is to learn skills. No support from anyone at all in the work place, I also find that blaming, lying and cheating to be very common in the construction sector, one of my contractors have sold their car and jewelries because they are not paid and their employees come to their house ask for pay. A lot of bosses are out to squeeze you hard for more productivity and after you become burnt out, hire new fresh grads replace you in this never-ending cycle. If you work contract without going thru your contract properly, beware of getting cheated. Working prospects are very depressing because job is just sugar coated slavery.

cxingt,"Glad to know you have identified and correctly left a toxic work environment. I'm just gonna say all of us have some assumptions about the working world and even life itself that might be or might not be correct. The key is to figure out which assumptions are inaccurate and slowly mould it to fit the reality more as we progress through life to avoid disappointment and frustration. That being said, we can't really generalise org culture by their size. There are toxic MNCs and SMEs alike and ""best place to work for"" MNCs and SMEs also.

Nowadays I see life choices more thorough the lens of the Monty Hall problem. Whatever we choose the first time around are highly likely to be incompatible, statistics-wise. Just keep moving, if it doesn't fit, move on, keep trying new things/environment until you find one that is comfortable for you or until you're jaded enough to mould your personality enough to be flexible for anything (but still keeping your integrity intact).

casphere,"From my personal experience, I don't think work culture/environment has much correlation to the size of a company. At least in Sarawak.

My first job was for a medium-large sized, listed company based here. I applied for sales executive at their Marine and Machinery division, but was expected to make sales for every other product in the company's catalogue, even those that I wasn't trained for. Yes I understand modern sales force especially for the likes of banks, are expected to be the frontier of the company, propagating for them rather than just your division, but I digress. I believe in specialization, not jack of all trades.

There was also the case of one of my training. I was sent to shipyards with a team of technicians to train for marine/ship engines, however I was expected to learn for example how to prime a brand new engine, how to guage and troubleshoot for problems, as well as take up tools twisting bolts and caps for oil change. I also wasn't given much primers to safety and regulations, no safety equipments besides a hard hat, and was literally skipping and ducking from boat to boat because there wasn't any proper docking as they were just stacked next to each other. Maybe I am overreacting over my incompetence as an initiate, but I really think there was a miscommunication regarding what I was really sent to be trained for, mistaken as a technician rather than a sales person.

Fortunately, overtime wasn't an issue. Regardless, I quit within the year over some other toxicity.

Eventually moved on to a tiny programming firm consisting of just 5 personnel including the boss. The work condition is really lax and I really don't have much to nit pick about. I stayed there for over 3 years and left to work for myself up until now.

My 2 cents is to do research for the company you're planning to apply for. Pull some strings to uncover anyone working from within for some insights. Expectedly this is harder to do for smaller more obscure companies but on the flip side, interviews for these companies tend to be more up close and personal since most are handled by the boss themselves. In this case, make the interview go both ways rather than just about you.",2021-09-18 02:02:47,employment trend,,reddit

Perakian,"> Older generation can brag about how

Lazy generalisation right there if I may say so.

Unions used to be strong in Malaya's/Malaysia's past and part of the labour laws we have now were directly influenced by them e.g. collective agreement, union representation, picketing and strikes, maternity leave, paid leave, sick leave, working hours etc. The efforts of older generation right there. 

Count yourself lucky you don't have US style *work at will* shit.

Now, bulk of OP's write up talked about issues which can mainly be identified in family owned businesses, small outfits and start ups. Start ups are more often than not headed by young energetic people, right? Who's doing the bragging there then? Family owned businesses or small outfits are the worst - doesn't matter if owned by a Malay or Chinese or whoever.

OP's issues include training, OSHA and personal development. The relevant labour laws can fix it like OSHA but some is simply beyond the scope e.g. corporate culture and stuff, as it currently is.

Edit: Today's article in [Malaysiakini](https://m.malaysiakini.com/news/591757). Don't think millennials are the only one treated like shit and slave.

While older employees often are only motivated by money, younger people are motivated by various different things.

I don't agree that putting in long hours is never worth it. Not everyone needs work life balance. Working harder, faster and better than your colleagues is how you stand out from your peers.

My humble suggestion would be to learn the tricks of the trade (would take around 8-24 months depending on your starting skill level and whether you are an ardent hobbyist?), and get out of whichever company you choose to work for ASAP. Starting your own micro-roastery isn't hard to maintain (relative to larger, commercial enterprises which need to pump products out every week) and you can set your own work schedule (limited/infrequent runs excite people since you know, people covet ""limited"" things). Another way to go about this is do some market research, find out what the community (and yourself!) like/have in common taste-wise, and collaborate/partner with an independent non-commercial **roaster**.

That's what most of us did when we started out! A part-time or weekend position is perfect to see if you can get acclimated to a radically different workflow/workplace. Or if you're looking to get a temporary break at work (not sure that's possible with corporate) you could travel up north to Penang/Bangkok or even down south to Malacca/Johor and try landing a bar position in their cafes (some cashier positions would be allocated bar training so just give it a shot!); granted, these positions aren't a dime a dozen, but there are cafes looking for part-time hires and they pay much better compared to the KL space (from what I've gleaned over the years as a fellow enthusiast travelling multiple cities to find coffee).

I did hear about Sony here doing some layoffs, so we're not immune. But I heard the EA here hasn't laid anybody off. So I think it's a mixed bag really. Also us in Malaysia are kinda the 'cheap labour' already so any company looking to save costs are more likely to be laying off somewhere closer to home probably, where their employees are much more expensive.

But Malaysia isn't like the bottom of the ladder. Like even over here we outsource, possibly to even cheaper countries. I've heard rumours about Sony focusing more on outsourcing to China using Malaysia as the in between hub - probably because of our bilingual people but these are all just rumours and I have no idea if they are true. 

I work for a Japanese MNC, and right now the exchange rate between Malaysia and Japan is increasingly unfavourable to Japan. So to the Japanese, Malaysia is getting more expensive(but I guess they don't exactly have many options, I reckon everywhere is going to be more expensive to them). So I'm not sure how much of a 'cheap labour' advantage I have these days, and maybe one day I'll get laid off and they'll all move to Vietnam or something - but this is all just personal speculation.",2024-04-29 06:03:56,employment trend,,reddit

,">I did in fact read the article. Does it not strike you as odd that this phenomenon is affecting the Malays specifically? Meanwhile, with other races, the uneducated have the highest unemployment rates.

That answer was on my last paragraph of my reply. Let me quote it for you again.

>The report noted that many job vacancies were for low- or semi-skilled work which was less preferable and “not suitable for fresh graduates”, adding that the bulk or 86.9 per cent of the 1.4 million vacancies available in 2017 were jobs that required only primary education, while 8.4 per cent were for semi-skilled jobs. In comparison, only 4.7 per cent or 64,402 job vacancies in 2017 were skilled jobs requiring tertiary education.

So while your first interpretation almost hit the mark, it was off by a little; the fact that uneducated Malays are more employed the educated ones is not just because they are going out being entrepreneurs, it is also because there is a higher job demand for lower skilled or uneducated Malays in the current job market. Another reason why Tertiary students couldn't find jobs is due to the skill gap (skills that are taught in universities do not match what is expected from the industry).

>“The high unemployment rate among those with tertiary education including graduates, in particular, Bumiputeras (4.6 per cent or 129,000 persons) and Indians (5.5 per cent or 14,500 persons) is mainly due to skills gap,” the report said.

I don't think it is right to attribute this problem to speculations like ""quotas"" because at the end of the day, it would not help to bring us closer to a solution. I have talked to people involved in this sort of surveys and the general consensus backed by data is a combination or the current job demand trends and universities are not doing enough to provide it's graduate enough skills that would be applicable in real life working experiences. It is not a ""Malay"" phenomenon, it's an ""every race"" phenomenon, with Indians and ""Other"" races being impacted the most percentage wise. It is exacerbated by the preference of field of study and also familial influence depending on the race. Malays can be very picky with their job choices after they graduate unlike their Chinese counterparts. I have many Malay friends who took gap years to look for jobs instead of my Chinese friends who immediately join the workforce after graduating due to family pressure. This contributes significantly to the data.

jcdish,"The passage you keep quoting actually supports my interpretation. There's a finite number of jobs available. I don't think anyone can argue with that. Jobs with low skill requirements outnumber jobs with high skill requirements. I also don't expect anyone to argue this point.

Unfortunately, life isn't fair. Not everyone can be a brain surgeon. Not everyone is a mathmagician or rocket scientist. But we don't need a million Einsteins and Hawkings, so things kinda work themselves out. The best of us are hired as professionals in whatever capacity they are qualified for. And like it or not, the not-so-brilliant ones end up as manual, unskilled labor, which we need a lot of.

Look at the charts for the Chinese and Indians. You can vaguely see the distribution - we have a lot of vacancies for low skilled jobs because that's just how things are, and unemployment rates are thus low for those who are less educated. Similarly, competition is tougher at the top, so we see higher unemployment rates.

The only outlier here is amongst the Malays, where the most educated ones have the highest unemployment rates. Why is that? Something must be messing with the statistics here - we have far too many graduates and they're fighting over a finite number of jobs. Meanwhile, the lower educated ones have an abundance of opportunities.

To me, is simple. The quota system is artificially inflating the number of people who qualify for higher education in a particular segment of our society. In our hurry to empower the Malays, we neglected the fact that people simply aren't made the same - some people are brilliant and others are not. You can't just lower standards and expect the job market to accept low quality graduates - corporations will hire the best and then what?

Why do we have this hard on for white collar jobs? Why must everyone be a doctor or engineer or accountant? Why are we neglecting the fact that people can be good at other things? Carpentry, music, art, fixing machines... Isn't it time we focused on empowering our youths to excel at what they're good at, instead of forcing them all to study study study?

,">To me, is simple. The quota system is artificially inflating the number of people who qualify for higher education in a particular segment of our society. 

Okay the problem here is your misunderstanding of what a ""quota system"" is. You are confusing it by defining it as a lower barrier to entry which is totally different. A quota system is for example out of 1000 seats 750 of it goes to Bumi, 250 goes to non-bumi. Remove the quota system and there are still the same number of seats. 

Now, here's the problem with your argument, ""Because the Bumis have quotas, they will be non-competitive and thus the quality of students going into the university will be worse and thus when they graduate they would have a hard time looking for a job."" 
This is a false assumption with no data to back it up. You are assuming students who enter through quota systems aren't of top quality and therefore have more difficulty finding employment when graduating and that's just false equivalency. 

Quotas might be a hindrance to creating racial unity or a truly meritocratic society but it is not by far the largest contributor to inflating the number of people who qualify for higher education as many people in this thread is claiming. There have been reports of abuse by universities by lowering the barrier of entry of students despite their poor grades just so they can earn a quick buck/ receive funding from the government for having a bigger student body. That is what is ""artificially"" inflating the number of people who qualify for higher education, not the quota. If the quotas did not exist, certain universities are still sneakily trying to enroll underachievers just to inflate their student body. However yet again my previous point, even if lowering the barrier of entry does increase the number of student body, it has no correlation to graduates not getting a job when they graduate. We can't just assume because they weren't good in studying during SPM thus they would not excel in university or life after university. 

The main reason has already been pointed out in the article; a mismatch of skills taught in universities and expected industry as well as the lower job demands of Tertiary students. We are producing too many tertiary students yes, but it's not due to the quota, it's just the path universities recently venture into which has been re-branded itself into degree mills rather than actually training students to be employed.

If you want to advocate for the removal of the quota system for societal fairness and meritocracy, that's fine by me. But attributing it to the low ability of graduates to be employed? That's a bit of a stretch. It's distracting from the actual problem at hand which is the quality of local universities. ",2018-11-07 19:33:57,employment trend,,reddit

Big 4 accounting and audit firms do this too for fresh grads. It's pretty much a meat grinder where you are overworked and underpaid for the first contract duration, and after which you take your ""I worked in a big 4"" creds and apply to a smaller firm asking for higher salary. Pay is good don't get me wrong, but it's shit compared to the work you're asked to do. Many of these firms give employees laptops so they can do the work out of office hours as well.

Additional_Sugar_849,"Firstly, where did you come up with “working for free”. Don’t think anyone mentioned about working without pay. That’s not even working, that’s volunteering. 

There is a saying “beggars can’t be choosers”.

While everybody wants a higher pay, no business wants to increase their cost of labor. That’s how the real world works. 

We have far more graduates now than we did in the past. Plus people who don’t have a degree but has worked in the field for decades. 

If I’m hiring and I have hundreds of applicants, you show up demanding xyz amount of salary, I won’t think twice to show you the door UNLESS you have the achievements and skills to backup your demand. 

The culinary world for example. Decades ago, barely anyone went to culinary school. It was the high school dropouts who started as dishwashers and worked for decades before becoming head chefs. The industry became saturated with dropouts like that. Now, especially with the rise of celebrity chefs and cooking shows, graduates who come out with a culinary diploma have to face the tough reality of low pay and starting from the bottom. As an employer, you cannot undermine the value of a dropout chef(who has worked in the field for decades) just because a fresh graduate arrived with a 3 year diploma and give the fresh graduate a similar range of salary. There is so much more technicality that goes on behind this.

ff56k,"This is a flawed argument because low pay applies across the board while your example of being able to work up from certain industries only applies to certain blue collar sectors. What if we take professional fields that people get degrees for like law or engineering? You can't enter those fields easily without a degree, you are still put up against a hundred applicants so if you don't have a degree and others do, you're shown the door as well. Despite that, the salaries are also low. You can't become an engineer eventually by starting as a construction worker. 

Another huge problem is when you compare that the same job in other countries pays fairly. 

Costs keep going up, but salaries stay stagnant. Some fresh grad salaries have even gone down since i started working more than 10 years ago.  My starting salary was RM3000, my father's starting salary almost 40 years earlier was RM2000. Yet inflation doubles prices every 20 years.

CN8YLW,"Everyone basically does it, is what I'm saying. Big corporations do it for some of their positions because these low paid employees are basically there on a very temporary basis, or at least while they're exploitable. Two years in that situation, and these ""exploitable"" workers suddenly become very much in demand in the market and are no longer exploitable, and the corporations hire new grads to fill those roles. Big corporations dont end up in the news that often because since they mix and match, they can always point to their section of well paid and happy employees as an example of how they're not exploiting their employees. They're also extremely clever about hiding these exploitations as well thanks to their well funded PR teams. Smaller corporations with much smaller worker pools very often fill these pools with exploitable labor, and basically go through those that cannot find employment by the bigger well paying corporations. 

&#x200B;

The whole employment dynamic is basically an employer paying an employee less relative to what they're worth to the company. An employee doing work worth $10,000 will be paid less than $10,000. The problem here is where's the line drawn. Giving that employee $3000 is exploitation, but so then is $9000. Difference between these two numbers is where the market rate is at. If market rate is $2000, then both are not exploitation, but if market rate is $9500, then both are exploitation. Then we ask, who or what determines the term market rate? Again, another ""wheres the line"" argument. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, my issue with this whole topic is that the big corporations very often market themselves as ""good to employees"", which most of them are not. One example is giving everyone laptops instead of having them use an office desktop, which in turn makes it difficult for employees to not work outside of office hours. Another example I know of is ending work day at 5pm (instead of 4) in an office that's situated in the city center, which pretty much means employees might be tempted to stay on a bit longer to do more work rather than jump into the massive traffic jams to arrive home at 8. Making workspaces larger and allowing employees to eat at their tables (Google even serves food from the canteen to the employee workstations iirc) means that employees will not waste time travelling to and from the canteen. Same argument applies to in-house gyms as well. Also the food ""perk"" allows the company to ensure its employees eat healthy as well, which in the long run helps reduce off and sick days resulting from adventurous eating habits.",2022-09-28 05:48:50,employment trend,,reddit

Now objectively speak - I am not trying to berate you ya :  
As an employee, who gives a fuck? Listen to yourself - you were on minimum wage - you were thinking FOR the management who is paid to solve this problem of not having a crew to open their shop. Again - how much money are we talking here? Asking you now. How much money for that unpaid to go to a interview that you know is inherently uncertain in itself. 

There we go - the uncertainty - staying to work that min wage guarantees pay. Taking a pay cut for that interview is risky and uncertain. So this boils down to if the min wage person has the balls to take that risk. If not, then tough luck because fortune ONLY favors the bold. 

Please don't let your ill placed sense of responsibility create a narrative where the management is at fault of what is going on in the job market. Employees also play a huge part and as soon as management sees that they can stretch you by not hiring more. Then the employee is just as complicit with the situation we find ourselves in now.

Currently i think he earns more than I do. Hahaha. 

Thing is, youngsters nowadays probably think older generation had it easy. Its not the case really. The way we searched for jobs in those days were printing alot of resumes. Send it to random companies either by hand or by post or by someone we know working in that company. And passport pictures. My god i lost count how many pictures i had to make. 

At 1 point i remember cash were running low. Went to a friend house who has a camera. Made a makeshift background. Took picture. Edit on his computer. Print alot of it. Paste on resume. And hope the company dont mind having a printed picture on a normal paper instead of those hard ones made at photo shops. Hahahaha. Damn, those were the days. 

Thing is, this is just my personal opinion, youth nowadays want a bigger salary fast due to peer pressure. Looking at their friends going on vacations, eat at expensive places, buying expensive things, even have latest phones. Have cool cars. All those are shared in instagram and facebook. 

So they probably feel pressured to experience the same thing. I think this is the reason because I think, if im still in my youth now, I would probably feel the same. Not to mention women expectation on men are way more higher now. Reading all the dating topics here, I feel bad for singles nowadays. Back then, couples believe in growing together.

Do you know what's the regulations n requirements of a kitchen setup & costing in order to get a license permit? What about the shop rental? Location? What sort of food you're selling?

Anyway, my point is always there, before having a clarity what u really want to do, just get a job 1st. Instead of keep telling the minimum wages isn't enough to survive. Find your way out. 

My 1st job were only paying 900 bucks n I only have 300 to spend on monthly food. But in the end I managed to work my way out n got a better offer elsewhere.

I've seen people who came back from overseas with master degree n can't get a job for over a year because even the hiring manager doesn't have a degree. Their afraid to hire because knowing that person will definitely replace them once they familiar with the job.

The current economy sucks n it will get worst.

Again, you talk with literally no real experience and substance. Ask me how I know a lot about those low paying job. Ask me how I know about the wage not being livable. Ask me how am I suppose to live with RM1200 wage (now 1500) if the rent is rm300 (for dumpster tier shared room 30kms out of city, how about you try finding one right now), 300 for food (no it's nowhere near enough, but let's use your number), 150 for bike/transport (if you're lucky, you got a free motorcycle which makes gas cheaper) and left with 450 for literally everything else.

couldikareless,"Weighing in here with my experience hiring fresh grads.

1. Either is fine imo unless the job specifically asks. But I'm quite sure hiring managers prefer something concise as ain't nobody got time to look more than 2 pages for a resume or CV. Look at Google or Canva for design inspiration. And if you are looking for a creative role (copywriter, illustrator, designer, architecture), absolutely include the link to your portfolio in the resume! The link can link out to behance/google drive/canva/google slides. Likewise engineers might use github. That is so crucial and makes a difference 
2. Education can just be 3 or 4 lines. Expand on job experience more, like tasks or responsibilities you learned as research assistant. Imo since you don't have too much job experience, volunteering also counts if you have some. It gives the impression you're assertive and have initiative
3. Skills that connect to experience and JD. Not much point putting photoshop knowhow for an admin role
4. I would personally list as stated above in 3 - 4 lines. If your CGPA is impressive, include that in. Include other highlights like dean's list etc/notable awards earned.
5. Do you have some experience outside of the university? Like personal projects where you can demonstrate experimentation in said technical skill. Not everything is learned at university after all and technical knowledge is important for some roles, e.g. no point hiring someone in programming if they don't know C++ or how to code.
6. The summary should describe you overall. Not just specific to job roles. But if you're very worried about 5 & 6 you should also write a separate cover letter to explain further why you are interested in that role and why they should take a chance on you.",2023-10-13 14:54:48,employment trend,,reddit

The rate of unemployment in germany is 5.7%.

Nothing wrong with that but why would you pay so much, as a malaysian national, to sort mail or clean kebab shops in germany, when you can already do that in malaysia and get paid 2-4k..?

Politics is common misinformation with many western politicians doing the same about Covid and eastern nations too. It’s politics for a reason. 

^ he also forgets Malaysia was one of the first country to begin looking into acquiring vaccination and had a higher vaccination rate. 

Education we aren’t as bad as perceived, it’s a tad of a myth. We aren’t as good as say Australia overall or America in higher education but when you do an actual comparison there isn’t many that are way ahead. 

In fact, several of those countries are experiencing an intelligence decline and having a number of controversies about their education quality and failed reforms.

As for EV etc. 

I am actually in green tech industry and there is a lot of misconception, the cost in fossils will increase until our infrastructure is in place. 

Malaysia is already doing better than every European country in renewable energy production.

Battery degradation does exist but harm from it is less than fossils fuel tho most cars will be going to hydrogen + ev in the future. 

Battery’s will also become more advance as time moves on.

All of these are not unique to Malaysia in terms of challenges but our industry is way ahead than the majority of the world in green tech at least. 

Only a few countries are on better level in tech eg: America, Australia and New Zealand as examples.

Statistically finance of the country isn’t bad its meh currently as the world is in a recession.

Statistically policies in Affirmative Action has gone a long way in equality and is also now being adopted by most developed nations. 

Tesla isn’t going to save the world via climate change (they popularised EVs tho and started a terrible trend of block cars), either he is citing a dumb statement made by that minister (which I can’t find, feel free to correct me) or his just spewing it. 

Malaysia has a whole load of national industrial programs aimed at developing our industry which is why we are ahead of Europe currently in green tech eg: 2nd largest supplier of PV tech, Higher renewable energy production, better public infrastructure for train vs say Germany, does not actively engage in large scale waste dumping overseas etc.

Similarly how Bajau ethnic groups varies by ethnicity and their indigenous to a land varies by those groups.

RemarkableSun8060,"Not all industries are booming but on average ALL INDUDTRIES they are growing far better than Malaysia. A .2% of increased unemployment rate is not worth mentioning. You are arguing a losing battle. Even blue collar jobs are seeing one of the highest pay hikes in recent decades. Restaurant industries, hotel, construction, etc. 

Also you are speaking as if big tech are the only ones booming lately. How about the Pharmaceutical companies? The US is the biggest exporter of pharmaceutical products in the world. Pfizer, J&J, Eli Lily, etc have seen ridiculous increase in sales over the past few years and wages have gone up. And then there is the oil & gas industry in Texas that is booming like crazy. They are even increasing oil & gas exports to Europe and so on. Many major big banks have increased pay by 10% last year for all of their junior execs. Yeah not all industries are booming but a lot of their industries are booming. Currently which sector in Malaysia is booming? I can't even think of one other than maybe commodities. Our tech & healthcare sectors are tiny as a proportion to GDP & most of our blue collar workers are hardly seeing any significant pay hike. So literally no industry in Malaysia is booming. The Bursa has seen its market cap dropped by 50% since  2021, the NYSE market cap has gone up by 20-30% since early 2021. It means that overall, all industries in the US are growing very quickly.

1. Too many foreign workers. 15 percent of the labour force are foreign workers. They can accept low salaries and live in relative poverty. Companies love these guys and frequently lobby the gov to keep bringing in more. So salary standards remain low.

2. Lack of workers unions. When was the last time you heard malaysians having a strike? Who negotiates for wages, benefits, allowances? Nobody thats who. When its just you against the company, you have no bargaining power, so we just accept the low wages and call it a day.

3. Lack of enforcement. How many people do you know who dont have engineering degrees do engineering work? Lack of enforcement on professionals is the reason why engineers have low wages. When anybody can become an engineer, your engineering degree is close to useless. Professionals like doctors are protected by law. Impersonating a doctor is a serious crime, which makes doctor salaries a premium.

These people do not care about society's woes or their protests; they only care about their profit margins, and what can the government even do to them?

4. Employers are also keeping the unemployment rate high to keep their bargaining power. That's what they'll say to you when you go for an interview, ""Why should this company pay you this much when there's so many willing to fill this job?"". Strong evidence of this, Ops HIRE 1.0 and 2.0 by MACC. 

5. As for the engineering jobs, it used to be qualified engineers only that can fill the position. But as time goes on, qualified engineers with degree becomes technicians with diploma. And further on, it becomes as long as its a warm body it'll do. Why this happens, well ""If there's any problem just call the vendor lar"".  

6. Before this, wage was never an issue because the people who complains are what they call irrelevant. If you're not a politician or the Dept of Labor then your views do not matter. The politicians lobby for foreign companies to setup shop with this one tagline, ""Malaysia has the lowest labor cost around"".

Malaysia produces nearly enough milk to supply local needs, yet go look at the cost of cheese and it's basically double what you would pay in the US, Europe or Australia.

,"OP, it also highly depends on what kind field you are applying it. From what it sounds like you are in IT related, and that field is always in demand with high growth and high competitiveness. People in IT roles commonly jump around to different companies for better offers. Not all career paths allows this.

Also, some fresh grads have already received job offers but feel that it is not suitable like company offering low salary etc. I am a psychology grad (2021) and I was offered 2k to teach special needs. Anyways, I ended up accepting a HR and recruitment position for 3k+ with much better benefits. 

Actively hiring also doesnt really mean shit. Example, I put up a job ad for a customer service position last month, 100+ people applied for it in the FIRST WEEK. I shortlisted and recommended 10 candidate profiles for consideration. The hiring manager picks 3 to interview and ends up hiring 1. It may seem that there are a lot of empty positions but the thing is that there are much much more viable candidates than there are empty positions available.

Its all just a numbers game, and the best I could say is just to keep on applying. Some people are lucky, some people are not lucky. Some totally qualified candidates end up being rejected just because they cant speak as good as the others even if they are still qualified for the position. 

One more thing is also discrimination. I work in recruitment so sometimes I will have to recruit for our clients (other companies some large some small). I literally get job orders with very specific and discrminatory requirements. Ex. Mandarin speakers only, must be under 25, must have car, must be male/female, must be bumi etc. 

I've had some really bullshit experiences where my candidates have been rejected. I remember after one interview the hiring manager told me rejected because person face ugly. Or they don't have the right energy. Or their medical results show that they are not 100% healthy.

We are not born equal and the world is an unfair, unjust place full of horrible people. Perhaps you are priveleged in some way and it may be hard to understand what others are currently going through but just because you and your cohort of UTAR grads dont find things difficult doesn't mean others don't have it hard.",2022-02-07 05:42:05,employment trend,,reddit

uwant_sumfuk,"Job hunting for fresh grads in MY is such a clusterfk that you can't just minimize it to grades. The market is so competitive that good grades alone can't get you a job.

First you got to think about the field, you mentioned that you got a job in Intel which makes me assume that you're in the IT field. The IT field is booming, lots of demand so IT graduates are likely to have an easier time finding a job that pays fairly well. Other fields do not have this same luxury. 4k and above starting salary for a fresh grad is also extremely rare and these jobs are usually super competitive. 

Two, the issues with being unable to get a job right out of uni falls on both the graduates and the company IMO. 

When I was interviewing for jobs, I would encounter other candidates particularly in group interviews. There were candidates who just couldn't ""speak"" well or sell themselves. All my interviews were conducted in English so I've seen candidates who couldn't speak it well. Some of them couldn't give natural answers to the questions that interviewers asked as their answers sounded super rehearsed that people could easily see through them. Some of them literally couldn't even answer the more deep or unique questions because they weren't prepared. Interviewers also want to know more about you as a person or at the very least, your extracurricular activities. There are people who genuinely don't have any hobbies and that's fine but interviewers might prefer people who do. 

On the companies' end, I agree with the top comment that ""actively hiring"" means jackshit. I've seen companies advertising the same position for at least half a year which makes me think that they're either advertising just for the sake of it, what they're offering isn't worth it or their standards are just too high which is why they have yet to hire. Discrimination is also a thing. I've known positions that hire only overseas graduates (this is for a large local bank), positions that only want a particular ethnicity, a particular gender etc. It's unfortunate that MY doesn't really enforce anti-discrimination laws like they do overseas. 

Besides that, the job hunting process is so demeaning and mentally exhausting. You have to go through several rounds of tests and assessments that take up so much time just for the chance to interview. Some interviewers are shit and literally patronize the candidates. You have job descriptions that are misleading or literally lying. Other than that, what the companies offer in the end might just be bad. RM2k in KL job isn't really viable considering the costs. Luck and connections do play an important role in job hunting as well.

3. Fake and rehearsed answers - trying to say something they think the interviewer wants to hear.

bullhugger,"Just some counter points to consider it may not truly represents the candidates because I'm not there.

1. Perhaps the candidate are introverted or prefers to not to mince their words. Then again they can just be difficult to talk to like you indicated which is crucial in certain profession where communication is the major factor.
2. These things naturally will be unclear to them. Without dipping your toes into real project/ responsibilities it is hard to tell. With time, it can be identified. Of course no one is obligated to hire them despite this, just giving a look into why it is so.
3. Understandable, they are increasing their odds of landing a job with researching the right thing to say. It can be a quality to others despite this. Again, no obligation for the other party to hire.
4. Depending on the role, it may not be the factor. Not everyone can open up and share their individuality at first meet. If candidate can perform the role or show signs of learning that is enough for some.
5. For some candidate it will be so, since they have yet to see the real industry. It may develop over time, but yet again, not obligated to take the risk.
6. Shouldn't impact their odds too highly. Being reserved doesn't mean they won't be invested into the product/ services. If the other party is confident with their product/ services, it will attract the right candidate eventually.

I might just misunderstand your take, but it doesn't hurt to look at things from both sides. Again nothing I gave as a counter point is the exact representation of the candidate, only the two party will know.",2022-02-07 08:33:23,employment trend,,reddit

Mandarin speaking required = Chinese only.

Indians get shafted no matter what due to stereotypes and generally poorer socioeconomic background.

This kind of racism is usually for SMEs, the company culture and hiring practices are racially driven like chinese company only hiring chinese, bumi company only hiring bumi.

But I've also encountered MNCs that also racially discrminate subtlely. They won't say it outright, but you just know when the hiring manager only hires people from X group or only accepts interviews from X.

IMO, the blue collar workers in Malaysia regardless whether they are locals or foreigners should be fairly compensated and should have a living wage in the cities where they work. The govt should also have different tiers of min. wage due to different cost of living in different states and cities. Eg. KL min wage should be higher than say min wage in Alor Star.
